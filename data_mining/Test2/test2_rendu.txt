12) What is the difference between PCA and SVD? 

pca= principal component analysis
svd = singular value decomposition

Both are closely related.

PCA only provides one set of basics vectors, where SVD will return 2 sets (rows and columns)

PCA is invariant to mean-translation, as contrary to SVD, which mean that PCA on non mean centered data will not gives the same results as the rows set vectors given by SVD. 


5) Why is it not enough to use one characteristic to describe the goodness of the classification 
model?
