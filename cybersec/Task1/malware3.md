## File System IOC (indicator of compromise)

We can find modification in files related to the history, the cache, and the cookies of Internet Explorer, probably to hide its presence.

## Network IOC

3 DNS request marked as "malicious":
* www.luigigiordano.org ( 213.205.40.169 )
* www.fmpromedia.com ( 195.78.215.76 )
* www.kreso.it ( 213.205.40.169 )

In addition to resolving this domains names, `fmpromedia` and `kreso` were also contacted.

`Suricata` (network threat detection engine) labelled those connection as malicious in the category `A Network Trojan was detected`

## Registry IOC

Modify the proxy settings, and read the `DISABLESECURITYSETTINGSCHECK`for Internet Explorer.

## Behavior and control flow

The analyse from `cuckoo.cert.ee` indicate that a thread was resumed because it was potentially an `indication of process injection`.

Seems to use internet cache setting to hide information that could be found in index.dat : we can find a query in the cache settings.
