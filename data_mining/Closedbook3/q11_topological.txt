convert structural graphs to multidimensional data by using quantitative
measures of important structural characteristics as dimensions

Nevertheless, topological descriptors have been shown
to retain important properties of graphs in the chemical domain, and are therefore used
quite frequently.

he utility of topological descriptors in graph mining is highly
domain specific. It should be pointed out that topological descriptors share a number of
conceptual similarities with the frequent subgraph approach in the previous section

Most topological descriptors are graph specific, whereas a few are node-specific. The
vector of node-specific descriptors can sometimes describe the graph quite well. Node specific
descriptors can also be used for enriching the labels of the nodes. Some common examples
of topological descriptors are as follows


Topological descriptors use quantitative measure from structural graph as dimensions. They are indexes used to describe the structure and the properties of the graph. Some topological descriptor are node specific, as Morgan Index (number of other node reachable within a distance k), or graph specific, as Weiner Index (sum of the pairwise shortest path). In some domain, as in chemistry (crystallography) topological descriptors help studying the structure of matter.
