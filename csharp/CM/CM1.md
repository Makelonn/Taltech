# Notes CM1

* Use teams to contact not mail
* Own laptop

To do:
* Repo name must be **ics0010-2021f** + don't forget gitignore
* Dotnet 5.0 SDK to download DONE
* Jetbrains reshaper


## Actually interesting things ? i guess

Solution = collection of projects

Create a console application on jetbrains and then you add more projects in the sol

## Youhoo some code finally

### Fields

like variables, can be read and set directly

### Properties

Have get and set procedures, more control over values

Auto-implementing property

Write in VS/Rider: prop + TAB for editor help

Need more control - have a backing field and provide logic for storing and retrieving

### Types 

When using `long`, need to add L a the end like `long myVar = 100000L;`

Same for `float` :  `float myVar=5.75F`

And `double` : `double myNum = 19.99D;`

`string`is surrounded by double quotes `"string"`

### Casting

*Implicit* when go to a larger type (for example char -> int or int->float)

*Explicit* when go to smaller type (long->int or double->float for example)

    double myD = 7.52;
    int myI = (int) myD;
