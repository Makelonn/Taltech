12) What is the difference between PCA and SVD? 

pca= principal component analysis
svd = singular value decomposition

Both are closely related.

PCA only provides one set of basics vectors, where SVD will return 2 sets (rows and columns)

PCA is invariant to mean-translation, as contrary to SVD, which mean that PCA on non mean centered data will not gives the same results as the rows set vectors given by SVD. 

5) Which one among the classification model goodness parameters (accuracy, precision, 
recall specificity, f1-score) are less sensitive to the data balancing?

Accuracy

precision depends on true positive and false positive
recall depends true positive and false negative
specificity depends on true negative and false positive
f1-score depends on recall&precision

Accuracy depends on the number of true classification (true positive + true negative) / number of total value, not anything to do with data balancing
